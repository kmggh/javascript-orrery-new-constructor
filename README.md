Adrian Cockroft, in his book and in the video on Youtube, *Function
The Ultimate*, at the YUI theatre, describes a better way to
instantiate objects.

This is my attempt to try it out for the orrery example.

This version was written for Node.js.


To run
------

    node run_orrery.js


Bugs
----

It would be nice to have command line arguments for setting the step size
and the number of steps.
